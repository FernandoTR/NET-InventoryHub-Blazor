# REFLECTION — InventoryHub Project

## 🧩 Overview
This project implements a full-stack inventory management system using Blazor WebAssembly and Minimal API.

## 🤖 Copilot’s Contributions
- **Integration:** Helped generate the initial HttpClient logic for fetching data.
- **Debugging:** Suggested fixes for incorrect routes and JSON errors.
- **Structuring JSON:** Generated nested JSON structures with categories.
- **Optimization:** Identified redundant API calls and proposed caching techniques.

## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings
- Handling CORS required configuring middleware correctly.
- JSON deserialization errors were solved by adding try-catch and ensuring property name case-insensitivity.
- Learned that Copilot is best used as a **pair-programming assistant**, not a code generator — guiding structure but requiring review.

## ⚙️ Key Takeaways
- Blazor and Minimal APIs integrate seamlessly with proper route management.
- JSON structure design directly impacts front-end deserialization.
- Small optimizations (like caching and avoiding redundant calls) significantly improve performance.
